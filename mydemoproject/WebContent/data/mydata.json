Also it takes around 1 hour 45 minutes to fully charge the latest oneplus 8 pro without warp charging.....The power bank never shows warp charging on oneplus 8 pro which is the latest device ...whereas the official charger takes only 70 minutes for fully charging the device...Bad quality when other brands are offering warp charge supported power banks for the similar price range... Buyers please don't consider the product for quality purchase...",

Earbuds are IPX4-rated, meaning they are resistant to water splashes from any direction, so you can keep listening rain or shine.",
				"productreview1":"I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...",
				"productreview2":"This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset. Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.",

However, a bit hard on the corners so needs some strength to apply it, which sometimes feels like may cause scratches or damage to the device itself. Also, seems to be turning yellow just in one week but that too seems to be a problem with Spigen cases.",

This is really cooper usb cable This is very difficult when our charging cabel damged & in market all chahines cable not charge phone with full speed because they are not made purely with copper.. This i recommend everyone just blind faith me & after u used u gives me thumbs",
				"productreview2":"Good quality cables from Amazonbasics. They are shielded and wires are good gauge to ensure that voltage drop is minimum and that results in faster charging of phones.Gold plating is not high micron and so fades away after use in few months although does not impact functioning in any noticeable way.The locking in USB port is good on both sides of the cable.Overall a good buy.",

Featuring energy-efficient, modular design, the Home Theater TV Backlight Kit from Inspired LED provides adequate bias light to reduce eyestrain, making your television display seem crisper and the colors appear more vivid. Product Placement Frequently used product placement behind flat screen TVs. This is a straight strip behind the TV along the back of the TV screen.",
				"productreview1":"This LED backlight strip is awesome. We have a 54 Panasonic Plasma and the strip fits perfectly. Our TV is on a stand sitting on a console (not wall mounted). I read this elsewhere, so I'll repeat it here: Get yourself some blue painters tape to temporarily mount the light strip to make sure it's in the right spot. About 8 thin pieces hold it up nicely (don't cover the LEDs!) so it can easily be moved again and again. Once you have it in the right place, just use the included sticky stuff.",
				"productreview2":"This light kit installed easily and quickly. I put them on the back of my Samsung 50 LED which is sitting about 15 away from the wall. I continue to be amazed at how much of an improvement this kit has made to my TV viewing.",

After removing the nano receiver from the battery compartment* and replacing the back cover, simply insert the receiver into the USB port of a compatible computer, flip the mouse’s power switch to “on” (located at the bottom), and it’s good to go.",
				"productreview1":"Average mouse, but expensive. Power switch is so small, you may need to use a microscope. Battery chamber is so weird that you can tell it's a bug converted into a feature. Manoeuvrability and size is decent. But it's heavy.",
				"productreview2":"the battery connection keeps on getting dislodged now and then and thus stpops working.have to open the battery compartment and reshuffle batteries to fit them in again to get going.",
